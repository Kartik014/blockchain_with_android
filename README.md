# Blockchain Integration with Android Application
Welcome to our project, which focuses on the integration of blockchain technology with an Android application. In this project, we've combined the power of blockchain and the versatility of Android development to create a basic application that interacts with a smart contract deployed on the blockchain.

# Overview
Technologies Used- 

Blockchain Platform: Ethereum

Smart Contract Language: Solidity

Android Development Language: Kotlin

# Project Description
Our project aims to demonstrate the integration of blockchain and Android by creating a simple Android application that interacts with a smart contract deployed on the Ethereum blockchain. This application allows users to store and retrieve data on the blockchain through two main functions:

Setter Function: This function allows users to store data on the blockchain. The data is securely recorded on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and immutability.

Getter Function: Users can retrieve the stored data from the blockchain using this function. The data is fetched from the blockchain and displayed within the Android application.

# Project Structure
Smart Contract: The smart contract, written in Solidity, defines the data storage and retrieval functions. It is deployed on the Ethereum blockchain.

Android Application: The Android application, developed using Kotlin, provides a user-friendly interface to interact with the smart contract. It initializes and calls the smart contract functions.
